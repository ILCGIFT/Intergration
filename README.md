# Python Data Hashing and Smart Contract Data Retrieval

## Introduction

This repository contains source code and examples demonstrating how to use Python to create hashes for data files and retrieve data from a smart contract on a blockchain network. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as data security or data integrity verification.

## Installation

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

1. Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repo-name
2. Install the required Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Data Hashing
To create a hash for a data file, you can use the hash_data.py script. Run the following command, replacing your_data_file.txt with the path to your data file:
python hash_data.py your_data_file.txt
This will generate a hash for the specified data file and display it on the console.

Smart Contract Data Retrieval
To retrieve data from a smart contract on a blockchain network, you can use the smart_contract.py script. Ensure that you have configured your blockchain connection details in the script. Then, run the following command:
python smart_contract.py
This script will interact with the smart contract and retrieve the desired data, displaying it on the console.
